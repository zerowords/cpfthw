	I have developed a handful of google appengine (gae) apps which I finally have realized are examples 
of CRUD on top of CRUD. That is, I, the administrator, offer my app to users so they can either 
use the app (say a note taker app) themselves or can invite other acquaintances, typically 
non-users, to exercise the ultimate app (for example, ParticiPoll, a participative questionnaire 
which uses the gae datastore and no SQL). My only and quite young grandson has 
asked me to produce a screencast video showing how such 2 layer CRUD's can be created, so that 
he can develop such apps, but I don't even have a coded demo to start from.

http://ParticiPoll.appspot.com/

I have studied and exercised the single layer note taking CRUD demo and have been impressed with 
it's simplicity and clarity. I have built another CRUD layer on top of that demo, in 
much the same format.

While in the original CRUD demo the "acquaintance" is greeted with a screen inviting her to 
create a note, in my extension the "user" is invited to Sign in and then create a Notebook into 
which "acquaintances" can add notes (anonymously). Of course that anonymity could be altered by 
a programmer editing the code. But the anonymity feature is a feature of my apps.
